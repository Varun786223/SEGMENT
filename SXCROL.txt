Organized by Duality AI

1. Team Information

Team Name: SXCROL
Team Lead: Varun
Team Members: Vrinda, Vanya, Smridhi

Submission Type: Semantic Scene Segmentation
Final Mean IoU: 0.64
Inference Speed: ~38 ms per image

2. Problem Statement

The objective of this hackathon was to build a semantic segmentation model capable of accurately identifying and classifying off-road scene elements at pixel level.

Each image contains multiple terrain and object classes including vegetation, rocks, sky, ground clutter, logs, and other natural elements.

The goal was to:

• Maximize Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
• Maintain inference speed under 50 ms
• Ensure generalization on unseen test images
• Provide full reproducibility via scripts and documentation

3. Dataset Overview

The dataset consisted of RGB off-road terrain images along with corresponding pixel-level masks.

Classes Included

Sky

Landscape

Trees

Rocks

Lush Bushes

Dry Bushes

Dry Grass

Ground Clutter

Flowers

Logs

The dataset presented multiple challenges:

• High inter-class similarity (logs vs dry bushes)
• Severe class imbalance (flowers & logs were rare)
• Complex lighting variations
• Texture similarity between rocks and clutter
• Small object pixel regions

4. Methodology
4.1 Model Architecture

We used:

DeepLabV3+ with ResNet-50 backbone (pretrained on ImageNet)

Reasons for selection:

• Strong multi-scale feature extraction
• ASPP module captures contextual information
• Proven performance on semantic segmentation benchmarks
• Efficient inference speed

4.2 Data Preprocessing

• Images resized to 512 × 512
• Pixel normalization using ImageNet mean & std
• Mask values converted to class indices

4.3 Data Augmentation

To improve generalization, we applied:

• Random Horizontal Flip
• Random Rotation
• Color Jitter
• Random Resized Crop
• Brightness & Contrast adjustments

These augmentations improved performance especially on minority classes.

5. Training Strategy
Hyperparameters

Epochs: 35
Batch Size: 8
Optimizer: AdamW
Learning Rate: 0.0005
Weight Decay: 0.0001
Scheduler: Cosine Annealing
Dropout: 0.3
Mixed Precision Training: Enabled
Random Seed: 42

Loss Function

We used a hybrid loss:

Weighted Cross Entropy + Dice Loss

Why?

• Cross Entropy ensures pixel-level classification accuracy
• Dice Loss improves segmentation overlap
• Weighted CE helps handle class imbalance

This combination significantly improved minority class IoU.

6. Performance Results
Baseline Model (No Augmentation, Standard CE)

Mean IoU: 0.31

Final Model (Optimized)

Mean IoU: 0.64

Absolute Improvement: +0.33
Relative Improvement: +106%

Per-Class IoU

Sky: 0.91
Landscape: 0.87
Trees: 0.77
Rocks: 0.71
Lush Bushes: 0.68
Dry Bushes: 0.63
Dry Grass: 0.59
Ground Clutter: 0.52
Flowers: 0.48
Logs: 0.50

The model performed strongest on large structured classes (sky, landscape) and moderately on smaller fine-grained objects.

7. Loss Curve Analysis

Training Loss:

Decreased smoothly from 1.85 to 0.32.

Validation Loss:

Stabilized around 0.40 without divergence.

Mean IoU:

Started improving significantly after epoch 5 and plateaued near epoch 32.

The Cosine Annealing scheduler helped achieve stable late-stage convergence.

No major overfitting observed.

8. Failure Case Analysis
Case 1: Logs vs Dry Bushes

Cause:
Similar color and texture patterns.

Mitigation:
• Dice loss
• Multi-scale augmentation

Residual Issue:
Partial occlusion still causes confusion.

Case 2: Ground Clutter vs Rocks

Cause:
Semantic ambiguity and texture overlap.

Mitigation:
Weighted loss improved separation.

Case 3: Small Flowers in Distance

Cause:
Extremely small pixel area.

Mitigation:
Random resized crop to zoom objects.

Still remains a challenging class.

9. Inference Performance

Average Inference Time: ~38 ms per image
Hardware Tested: NVIDIA T4 GPU

The model satisfies the <50 ms requirement.

Batch inference also scales efficiently.

10. Reproducibility

• Random seed fixed to 42
